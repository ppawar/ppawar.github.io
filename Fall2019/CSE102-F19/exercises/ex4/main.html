<h2>The Future college landscape is undergoing a transformation</h2>

<p>
Digitalisation, increasing international competition and growing individualisation present universities with new challenges. How will knowledge be communicated effectively in the future, and what are the skills that universities will need to equip students with? And what kind of ecosystems will we find in tomorrowâ€™s university landscape?

The TIMBUKTU foundation recently introduced the FUTURE COLLEGE initiative in cooperation with the think tank W.I.R.E. The launch event welcomed over 100 decision-makers from the African university landscape and gave them much to think about regarding trends in education and research.
