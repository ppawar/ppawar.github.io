            <p>
            Working with others on assignments is a good way to learn the material and we encourage it. However, there are limits to the degree of cooperation that we will permit.
			<br><br>
			When working on programming assignments, you must work only with others whose understanding of the material is approximately equal to yours. In this situation, working together to find a good approach for solving a programming problem is cooperation; listening while someone dictates a solution is cheating. You must limit collaboration to a high-level discussion of solution strategies, and stop short of actually writing down a group answer. Anything that you hand in, whether it is a written problem or a computer program, must be written in your own words. If you base your solution on any other written solution, you are cheating.
			<br><br>
			It is okay to help other students, within limits. If you are asked for help by another student, two things that are absolutely forbidden are to show that student your solution or to put your hands on that student's keyboard or paper. That isn't helping; that is facilitating cheating! Instead answer questions, give tips, help with tools, explain Python, point out a bug, and/or give encouragement. In other words, interact with other students the way that the TAs do.
			<br><br>
			When taking an exam, you must work completely independently of everyone else. Any collaboration here, of course, is cheating.
			<br><br>
			<em>We do not distinguish between cheaters who copy others' work and cheaters who allow their work to be copied.</em>
			<br><br>
			If you cheat, you will be referred to the appropriate office at the University. If you have any questions about what constitutes cheating, please ask.
			<br><br>
			The statement from the university on academic integrity is: Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person's work as your own is always wrong. Faculty members are required to report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary Committee or the Department of Academic Affairs, Campus Building A, Room 201, (032) 626-1121.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Students with Disabilities</h2>
            <p>
			If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact the Department of Student Affairs, Campus Building A, Room 207, (032) 626-1190. They will determine with you what accommodations, if any, are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential. 
            </p>

			<h2 class="content-subhead">Critical Incident Management</h2>
            <p>
			SUNY Korea expects students to respect the rights, privileges, and property of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Department of Academic Affairs any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits students' ability to learn.
