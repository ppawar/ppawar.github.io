            The course provides a total of 500 points distributed across the following categories. 
			<ul><li>
			<b>Class Participation: 5% (25 points).</b> 
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Assignments: 35% (175 points).</b> 
			</li>
			<li>
			<b> Labs: 15% (75 points)</b>Weekly graded laboratory assignments.
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Quizzes: 25% (125 points) </b>Short quizzes will be given on concepts in the reading. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
			<b>Comprehensive Final Exam: 20% (100 points)</b>  An exam covering all the concepts covered during the semester.
			</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Your final grade is calculated by the total points you accumulate in the class.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Important note: </b>You must attain a grade of at least 50% on exams and 50% on assignments to achieve a grade higher than C-. Additionally, if you have over 20% unexcused absences, the final course grade will be an F.
			<br>
			Makeup examinations will only be given for extenuating circumstances (e.g. hospital admission) or for verified, officially sanctioned university activities. All makeup examinations may be oral.

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Regrading</h2>
            <p>
			<ul>
			<li>Should you discover what you think is an error in grading your work, you have exactly one week after the grades are made available to you to request a regrade - no exceptions. </li>
			<li>To promote consistency of grading, questions and concerns about grading should be addressed first to the TA and then, if that does not resolve the issue, to the instructor. </li>
			<li>You are welcome to contact the TA by email or come to their office hours. If you would like to speak with the TA in person and have a schedule conflict with their office hours, you are welcome to make an appointment to meet the TA at another time. </li>
			<li>For the final exam, there will be a special office hour designated to resolve any grade queries or disputes. This will be announced after the final exam. The final exam papers will not be returned.</li>
