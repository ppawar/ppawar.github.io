            <p>
			<ul>
			<li>Should you discover what you think is an error in grading your work, you have exactly one week after the grades are made available to you to request a regrade - no exceptions. </li>
			<li>To promote consistency of grading, questions and concerns about grading should be addressed first to the TA and then, if that does not resolve the issue, to the instructor. </li>
			<li>You are welcome to contact the TA by email or come to their office hours. If you would like to speak with the TA in person and have a schedule conflict with their office hours, you are welcome to make an appointment to meet the TA at another time. </li>
			<li>For the final exam, there will be a special office hour designated to resolve any grade queries or disputes. This will be announced after the final exam. The final exam papers will not be returned.</li>
